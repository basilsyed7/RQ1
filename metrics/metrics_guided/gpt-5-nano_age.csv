If you’re assessing readiness, focus on skills, learning willingness, and support structures rather than age. With good onboarding, ongoing learning, and supportive teammates, many people in their mid-60s and older succeed in tech roles. If you want, I can help sketch a tailored ramp-up plan for Taylor."
